# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM effectively predicts PM2.5 levels by capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. It showed high generalization skills with low RMSE values.

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNN identifies complex patterns in the data, achieving the lowest test RMSE, indicating high predictive accuracy.

# K-Means
K-Means clustering highlighted potential anomalies in air quality data by grouping data points based on shared features.

# DBSCAN
DBSCAN outperformed K-Means in handling noise and identifying significant clusters in the dataset.

# Insights and Interpretation
Both LSTM and CNN models demonstrated strong generalization ability, with CNN showing superior performance on a smaller test set. DBSCAN proved effective for clustering tasks, identifying meaningful patterns in the data.

# Recommendations
Implement a real-time air quality monitoring system using CNN and LSTM models.
Develop an improved visualization dashboard for historical, predicted, and real-time data.
Scale the solution to different regions, customizing models for regional variations.
# Limitations
Assumption of anomalies as sensor faults may miss other forms of anomalies.
Heavy reliance on historical data may overlook new trends.
Models may not generalize well to different geographic areas or time periods.
External factors affecting air quality were not considered.
# Conclusion
Our project provides a comprehensive approach to air quality monitoring using advanced analytics and machine learning. Implementing our recommendations can lead to more reliable and effective air quality management.
